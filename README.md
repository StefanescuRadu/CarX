# CarX

At the end of the first sprint I added the following functionalities: register/login,Brands page where you can select one of them,Brand page with it's respective cars and Car page.
On the next sprint I intent to do the following: add Spring Security,adding individual logo and image for each brand,optimizing images.I will make 2 types of users.
Admin who will have abilities like add/remove/edit brand/car  and user who will be able to configure it's car and add it to favourite (for both users you can do it only from backend).
